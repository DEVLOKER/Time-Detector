# Time-Detector
Python program for calculating time of analog clock image based on clockwise angles.
- firstly, searching of analog clock center, and drawing circle on it.
- after that, draw clockwise lines from center of analog clock.
- calculate the length of each clockwise, the short one for hours, and the longest for minutes.
- finally, calculate time (Hours:minutes) based on drawn clockwise lines angles.
Time Detector is a Python program designed to accurately calculate the time of an analog clock image based on clockwise angles.
